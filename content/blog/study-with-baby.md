Over the past few weeks, I’ve been prepping for the **AWS Solutions Architect Associate** exam, with the **Security Specialty** lined up next. It’s been a challenge balancing study time with errands, workouts, and life with a baby at home—but here’s what’s helping me stay consistent:

- **Text-based resources over video**  
  I retain info way better when I can read and annotate at my own pace. I don't always have time to watch video content all the way through, and pausing/resuming videos doesn’t work well for me.

- **Anki for spaced repetition**  
  I found some custom decks that cover the core exam topics (IAM, VPC, EC2, RDS, etc.), and it’s been a game changer for retention. I can run through flashcards during downtime—even on the Stairmaster at the gym.

- **Focusing on why, not just what**  
  Understanding AWS design principles (like scalability vs. cost optimization) is way more useful than just memorizing definitions.

- **Micro-sessions > marathons**  
  Sometimes I only get 20 minutes while the baby naps—and that’s still progress.

If you’re also studying for AWS certs—or balancing learning with parenthood—I’d love to hear what’s working for you.

**What’s your #1 tip for staying on track with cert prep or self-study?**
