Unbeknownst to me at the time, my manager had nominated me for the **Fox Star Award**, a prestigious award given to roughly 50 out of 1,300+ CARFAX employees each year. I was honored to receive the award during the company’s annual FY23 meeting in recognition of my contributions to modernizing and expanding the Carfax for Police systems.

## CompTIA Security+ Certification

Security+ was my first formal step into the world of cybersecurity and risk-driven thinking. Preparing for the exam helped solidify my foundational knowledge of security principles, network defense, and secure software development practices. A huge part of my success was thanks to [Professor Messer’s free Security+ course on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/professormesser), which provided clear, approachable explanations that were instrumental to my success on this exam. Earning this certification not only validated my skills but also deepened my interest in building secure, reliable systems—an area I continue to focus on in my professional work.
