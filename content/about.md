## Beyond the Code

Want to get to know me outside of work? Here’s a glimpse at what I’m passionate about when I’m not building software.

### 🎮 Gaming

I’m a longtime gamer with some of my favourite series including titles such as *Mass Effect*, *The Witcher III*, and *Pokémon*. That said, no game has consumed more of my time (or brought me more joy and chaos) than *Overwatch*. I proudly main Reinhardt—and yes, I’ll shout **“FOR GLORY!”** before solo-shattering an enemy Mercy without hesitation.

### 🏋️‍♂️ Fitness

Fitness is a big part of my routine, especially as I settle into my 30s. I follow a strength-focused training plan, lifting several times a week to stay energized, focused, and healthy. It’s one of my favorite ways to disconnect and recharge.

### 📚 Reading

I’m a huge fan of sci-fi and fantasy, particularly stories that combine big ideas with great character arcs. *Red Rising* and *The Stormlight Archive* are my all-time favorites, and I’m always on the lookout for the next great series to dive into.

### 🧠 Lifelong Learning

Whether it’s grinding through technical docs for a certification, experimenting with random hobbies like wood whittling, or learning to play the ocarina, I’m constantly chasing new knowledge. I love exploring new skills just for the fun of it.

### 🧀 A (Very) Fun Fact

I don’t like cheese. At all. Not on pizza, not in pasta, not even melted on a burger. I’ve heard “you just haven’t found the right cheese” more times than I can count—but trust me, it’s not for lack of trying. I’m the anomaly in a dairy-loving world, and I’m okay with that.
