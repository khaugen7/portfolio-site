## Personal Portfolio Website

This website you're looking at right now!

### Overview 
This website serves as my personal portfolio, showcasing my technical projects, professional experience, and areas of interest. Itâ€™s built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and flexible static site generator, and styled using the [Blowfish theme](https://blowfish.page/), which provides a clean, responsive design. The site is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for continuous deployment and hosting.

### Tech Stack
- **Hugo**: Chosen for its speed, simplicity, and markdown-based content management.
- **Blowfish Theme**: Offers customizable components, a minimalist aesthetic, and strong support for syntax highlighting and project pages.
- **Netlify**: Provides seamless CI/CD integration and reliable static site hosting with custom domain support and HTTPS.

### Features
- Dedicated pages for featured projects with descriptions and tech used
- Responsive layout for mobile and desktop
- Easy content management via Markdown and Git
- Custom domain - because who doesn't love seeing their name in the search bar?

### Why I Built It
I wanted a platform that was fast, flexible, and easy to maintain without relying on a heavy CMS. Hugo offered a developer-friendly experience that fit my workflow, and Blowfish gave me a solid visual foundation to build from. As a backend developer, I didn't want to be spending a lot of time perfecting CSS classes and managing front-end display so this combination was lightweight enough to get up and running quickly. Hosting on Netlify means every update via Git is reflected almost instantly, making iterations simple and efficient.
