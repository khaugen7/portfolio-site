Welcome to my portfolio. I'm a backend engineer who enjoys building scalable cloud services using Go, Python, Java, AWS, and Kubernetes. I'm currently exploring cloud security and high-throughput system design.

## Work Experience

**Software Engineer – CARFAX**

At CARFAX, I lead backend engineering efforts focused on cloud-based machine learning infrastructure. I’ve designed and deployed a Kubernetes-based platform on AWS to support scalable ML workflows, and helped migrate critical services from legacy systems to containerized environments. I’ve also implemented data lineage tracking with DynamoDB to improve observability and compliance, and regularly contribute to performance tuning and cost optimization across our CI/CD pipelines.

**Cybersecurity Instructor – Fanshawe College**

Before transitioning full-time into industry, I taught cybersecurity at the college level. I developed and delivered curriculum on secure software development, network security, and threat modeling, with an emphasis on real-world application. This role reinforced my commitment to building secure systems and communicating complex technical topics clearly—a skill I carry forward into engineering leadership.
