## Work Experience

**Software Engineer â€“ CARFAX**

At CARFAX, I lead backend engineering efforts focused on cloud-based machine learning infrastructure. Iâ€™ve designed and deployed a Kubernetes-based platform on AWS to support scalable ML workflows, and helped migrate critical services from legacy systems to containerized environments. Iâ€™ve also implemented data lineage tracking with DynamoDB to improve observability and compliance, and regularly contribute to performance tuning and cost optimization across our CI/CD pipelines.

**Cybersecurity Instructor â€“ Fanshawe College**

In addition to full-time software engineering, I taught a semester of a cybersecurity course at the college level. I developed and delivered curriculum on secure software development, network security, and threat modeling, with an emphasis on real-world application. This role reinforced my commitment to building secure systems and communicating complex technical topics clearlyâ€”a skill I carry forward into engineering leadership.
